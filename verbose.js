Since NeurotechX is a bootstrapped non-profit, we are unable to pay for the premium version of Slack and therefore all messages after 10,000 are deleted. We have built a temporary solution by archiving all of the text onto our Github page. You can visit the list of archived text here. We only track public channels.

Hey! I hope you are having a lovely day, because I’m having the time of my life! What a time for ChatBots to be alive.
Listen, as much as I’d like to chit chat with you, I’m actually writing to you because I’ve noticed that you are not on the *NTX - Digest* list and therefore are not receiving the awesome news and opportunities NTX is sharing with its community. 

The good news is that I’ve got your back and you can fix that with only 1 click (+2-3 fields to fill):
http://bit.ly/ntx-digest  

But hey, if you want to miss the next big thing in NeuroTech, it’s ok.
_(If you are on the list but used a different name and/or email, please let me know so I don’t bug you anymore)_
