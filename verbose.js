Since NeurotechX is a bootstrapped non-profit, we are unable to pay for the premium version of Slack and therefore all messages after 10,000 are deleted. We have built a temporary solution by archiving all of the text onto our Github page. You can visit the list of archived text here. We only track public channels.
